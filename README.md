# Github-style consistency graph

A daily visual progress tracker inspired by the github contribution graph. The app will allow the user to check the day off as done (for tracking any goal). Progress will be saved in browser storage, and the graph will keep track of time and advance forward each day.

The user can initialize the graph, manually advance the day (for testing), and add or delete graphs.
